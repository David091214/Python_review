print("hello world ")

print(type(3))


# this basically divided 5 by 2 twice and since 
# and since 2 cannot go into 5 3 times it outputs 
# the value 2 
print(5 // 2 )  

# in respect to the above solving if you
# want to see the remainder we use modulus
print(5%2)


# similar to the hand expression of solving 
# which is 5^2
print(5**2)
